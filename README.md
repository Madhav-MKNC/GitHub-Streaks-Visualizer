## Overview

GitHub Streaks Grapher is a powerful web application designed to take your GitHub contribution tracking to the next level. Unlike conventional streak trackers that show only the highest and current streaks, this tool offers an in-depth exploration of your contribution history over time.

Powered by GitHub's API and tailored to your profile, this application calculates streaks by identifying uninterrupted sequences of days with contributions. The resulting insights are then translated into an interactive graph, where streak lengths are plotted on the y-axis against days on the x-axis.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Visualization:** Get a holistic view of your GitHub activity with a graph that showcases all your contribution streaks.
- **Interactive Experience:** Hover over data points to reveal specific streak details, including start dates and streak lengths.
- **Personalized Insights:** Dive deep into your GitHub journey by exploring your historical contribution patterns.
- **Easy to Use:** Simply enter your GitHub username to generate your streak visualization in moments.
- **Customizable Graphing:** The application utilizes a versatile graphing library, allowing for visual customization and responsiveness.
